# Email Verification Deployment Guide

## Overview
The FitBite app now includes a comprehensive email verification system that ensures users verify their email addresses before completing account registration.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. User Experience Improvements
- ✅ Clear email confirmation UI after signup
- ✅ Step-by-step instructions for users
- ✅ Resend confirmation email functionality
- ✅ Error handling for failed verifications
- ✅ Automatic profile creation after email confirmation

### 2. Production URL Configuration
- ✅ Environment-based redirect URLs
- ✅ Support for both NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL and VERCEL_URL
- ✅ Fallback to localhost for development

## Required Environment Variables

### For Production Deployment

Add these environment variables to your deployment platform (Vercel, Netlify, etc.):

```bash
# Required: Your production site URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://yourapp.vercel.app

# Existing Supabase variables (already configured)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key

# Other existing variables...
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
NUTRITIONIX_APP_ID=your_nutritionix_app_id
NUTRITIONIX_API_KEY=your_nutritionix_api_key
```

### Environment Variable Priority
The system uses this priority order for redirect URLs:
1. `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` (highest priority)
2. `https://${NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_URL}` (if deployed on Vercel)
3. `http://localhost:3000` (development fallback)

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Set Environment Variables
In your deployment platform, add:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://your-actual-domain.com
```

### 2. Update Supabase Email Templates (Optional)
You can customize the email verification template in your Supabase dashboard:
- Go to Authentication > Email Templates
- Edit the "Confirm signup" template
- Customize the styling and messaging

### 3. Test Email Verification Flow
1. Deploy your application
2. Sign up with a new email address
3. Check that the confirmation email contains the correct production URL
4. Verify the email verification flow works end-to-end

## Security Features

### Rate Limiting
- Signup: 5 attempts per 15 minutes per IP
- Resend: 3 attempts per 5 minutes per IP
- Email resend: Built-in Supabase rate limiting

### Input Sanitization
- All email and name inputs are sanitized
- Email validation with proper regex
- Password strength requirements

### Secure Responses
- No sensitive information in error messages
- Consistent response format
- Proper HTTP status codes

## User Experience Flow

1. **User signs up** → API creates auth user with email confirmation required
2. **User sees confirmation screen** → Clear instructions with email address shown
3. **User clicks email link** → Redirects to `/auth/callback` with verification code
4. **System verifies code** → Creates user profile and logs user in
5. **User redirected to app** → Seamless transition to authenticated state

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Production emails still have localhost URLs**
   - Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` is set in production environment
   - Check deployment platform environment variable configuration

2. **Email verification fails**
   - Check Supabase email confirmation settings
   - Verify redirect URL matches your domain
   - Check browser network tab for errors

3. **Resend email not working**
   - Rate limiting may be active (wait 5 minutes)
   - Check Supabase email rate limits
   - Verify email address format

### Monitoring
Monitor these metrics in production:
- Email confirmation success rate
- Time between signup and email confirmation
- Resend email usage patterns
- Error rates in auth callback

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Custom Email Templates**: Customize Supabase email templates with your branding
2. **Email Analytics**: Track email open rates and click-through rates
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Add real-time email status checking
4. **Mobile Deep Links**: Configure mobile app deep linking for email verification
5. **Multi-language Support**: Add internationalization for email confirmation flow
